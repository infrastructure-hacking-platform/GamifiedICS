# Gamified ICS
Gamified ICS intends to educate about Industrial Control Systems (ICS), simulating their various uses and how they can be exploited.

Using Unreal Engine 5, we designed the environment to be relatively realistic. The user will have the opportunity to explore, 
interact with, and hack a variety of ICS systems placed throughout a city landscape.
